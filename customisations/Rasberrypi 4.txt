The Placestation Pro integrates a Raspberry Pi 4 as its onboard controller, replacing the single-board computer used in the original LumenPnP design.
This upgrade delivers significantly faster processing, more USB bandwidth, and improved network performance, enabling smoother motion control and higher-speed vision processing for demanding production runs.
